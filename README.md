# Robust-Hybrid-Model-For-Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis

Social media platforms are home to massive amounts of content created by users, which can offer insightful information on attitudes and beliefs. In order to extract valuable information from this abundance of data, sentiment analysis is essential. This work presents a novel hybrid sentiment analysis model using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa) models. The model aims to improve sentiment classification by utilizing the advantages of both models.

Traditional sentiment analysis models, such as rule-based systems and machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and support vector machines, often struggle with the complexities of social media text. These issues include contextual understanding, linguistic complexity, inherent data variability, and noise. This hybrid analysis, on the other hand, excels at understanding natural language semantics and gathering contextual information.

# Model Training and Evaluation
The hybrid model combines data and an innovative training approach to improve performance. The evaluation process involves reporting accuracy metrics using a test dataset. Additionally, a thorough classification report and confusion matrix are produced. The test dataset performance evaluation yields an accuracy of 82%.

# Performance Metrics
Accuracy: 82%

Evaluation Tools: Classification report and confusion matrix

This hybrid sentiment analysis model demonstrates a significant improvement in understanding and classifying sentiments in social media text, thanks to the combined strengths of BERT and RoBERTa.
